PROBLEM
    I want to create a word game for my son.
    I want to be able to spin six blocks, each with four sides and each side with a letter, so
    that I have a reasonable chance of producing a word.
    Some words can be four or five characters.
    Words should singular, common nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives

SOLUTION OPTION #1
    Find a list of words with 4,5,6 characters each.
    For each, count the frequency of each character.
    Take the top four. The naive assumption is that local optimums will produce a global
    optimum.

SOLUTION OPTION #2
    Create a program that permutes the possible combinations for possible words that have
    4,5,6 characters, so that each permutation, like
    [s,d,a,e],[y,e,q,e]...[nnn,nnn], and for each permutation, check if each possible word
    can be derived.
    THIS MAY TAKE A VERY LONG TIME

I am thinking the naive approach is good enough.
